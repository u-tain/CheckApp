## CheckApp
Desktop application for receiving an excel file from the receipt of the store "Lenta".

Have you ever had situations when you went to a hypermarket with a large company and made joint purchases. In this case, you are left with one big check, according to which you need to pay each. I myself have been in this situation many times. It was clear that it was most convenient to read the check in an Excel file, but copying all the products and prices into it was not the most fun thing to do. So I finally made up my mind and wrote a desktop application for my personal use and present it to you.

You can find the download application and instructions in this [telegram channel](https://t.me/check_app_tata). Updates will be posted here and you can leave comments here.
